  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DIMENSIONLESS TECHNOLOGIES <em>(Machine Learning Intern)</em>-2 Dec'19 to 6 Mar'20</strong></li>
    <p>Worked on data annotation and machine learning. Used AWS S3 and EC2
      instances. Prepare dataset for training the model. Also worked on
      CVAT Computer
      Vision Annotation Tool to annotate the objects.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li><strong>BENNETT UNIVERSITY <em>(deep learning and AI Intern)</em>-11 May'20 to 19 Jun'20</strong></li>
    <p>Developed an AI application Speech Emotion recognition using Machine Learning and Deep learning.</p>
  </ul>

  <h3>Projects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING</strong></li>
    <p>Emotions are an important part of understanding human interactions. Research is going into finding methods that can at the very least mimic human ability to recognize emotions displayed in the form of facial expressions, changes in tone while
      speaking, etc. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is one such field. Using deep learning and machine learning algorithms with the help of the RAVDESS and TESS dataset aim to design an automatic emotion recognition system.</p>
    <br>

    <li><strong>HAND GESTURE CONTROL OF YOUR COMPUTER (IOT MINI PROJECT)</strong></li>
    <p> Gesture-based navigation has become an alternative to Normal navigation. Instead of using a keyboard, mouse, or joystick, we can use our hand gestures to control certain functions of a computer like to play/pause a video, move left/right in a
      photo slideshow, scroll up/down in a web page, and many more.</p>
    <br>

    <li><strong>ONLINE SPORTS VENUE BOOKING SYSTEM (WEB DEVELOPMENT MINI
        PROJECT)</strong></li>
    <p>A web platform for sports enthusiasts to find turf at their convenient location for different sports and book the slots accordingly. </p>
    <br>

    <li><strong>SECURE ATM USING MULTILEVEL AUTHENTICATION ANDROID APP
        (SUMMER PROJECT)</strong></li>
    <p> Developed an Android which triggers before the withdrawal of cash from ATM and uses multiple factors to make sure that the cardholder is the authenticated person for the withdrawal of cash.</p>
    <br>

    <li><strong>EPILEPTIC SEIZURE PREDICTION USING CNN (FINAL YEAR PROJECT)</strong></li>
    <p>The final year project is to develop an AI application to help people who are suffering from epilepsy disease. Epilepsy is a typical neurological disorder that influences the person with epilepsy both socially and culturally, especially in
      India and other parts of the world. Epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal activities in the brain which will affect the patient’s health. If the occurrence of seizure could be predicted well in advance, it could be prevented through
      medication or proper actions. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is generally used to detect epilepsy as EEG is capable of capturing the electrical activity of the brain. The early prediction of arriving seizure has a great impact on a patient's
      health. The deep learning algorithm used for the project is CNN. </p>
